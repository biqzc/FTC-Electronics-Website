# What is FTC Electronics?
FTC Electronics is the only electrical guide you'll need when building your robot; we cover the basics of wiring, how to manage ESD, and how to make custom PCBs along with their applications to FTC. We decided to make this website after seeing that there were a lack of resources for help with electrical in FTC, other than the lackluster advice which can be found on the FTC Discord. We aim to help as many teams as possible by providing documentation, tutorials and a Discord community where unlike the FTC Discord, people actually know what they're talking about and can provide adequate support. 
# Who are we? 
The primary members of FTC electrical are the former FTC Discord members Allen B Hwang, otherwise known as "Yengkee Noodles" and Erwin "Erdiddy" Herrera, otherwise known as "Biqzc". We are both members of 14343 Escape Puyallup based in the greater Puyallup metropolitian area. 
## Getting Started

We have split the website into three sections, wiring, ESD mitigation and PCBs. 


[Wiring](wiring/index.md): Wiring is the one of the most basic, but also one of the most difficult parts of electrical. This section will explain how to route wires, manage wires on moving mechanisms, and more.

[ESD](static.md): Electrostatic Discharge causes issues for many teams, but there are simple ways to mitigate the effects.

[Sensors](sensors.md): Sensors enable the robot to sense its surroundings, which can help with automation in many different aspects.

[PCBs](pcbs.md): PCBs can be used to add custom sensors, LEDs, and more to your robot.
